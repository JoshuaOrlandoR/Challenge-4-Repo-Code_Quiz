# Challenge-4-Quiz!
This challenge involves writing code from scratch to match challenge requirements. 
This week, I created a quiz with logic through Javascript!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description
In this assignment, I wrote the necessary code to create a functional quiz. 
Through my practice with JavaScript as well as using API's to help manipulate data, I was able to create a quiz that kept track of score and time.

Upon completing the quiz, users can log their score with 3 initials, which will then be placed into the leaderboard. The newest 5 entries will be kept here.
The only non-functional part of the code is the leaderboard button on the landing page, as it only shows a blank table. 

There is also a bug regarding choice selection. Users need to, at the current iteration of the site launch, click on the answer text or the white space that surrounds it.
I have a feeling this might have something to do with a propogation bug, but wasn't able to sort it out in time. I will return to this later.
