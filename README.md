# Challenge-4-Quiz!
This challenge involves writing code from scratch to match challenge requirements. 
This week, I created a quiz with logic through Javascript!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description
In this assignment, I wrote the necessary code to create a functional quiz. 
Through my practice with JavaScript as well as using API's to help manipulate data, I was able to create a quiz that kept track of score and time.
One major requirement however, which as storing player information and score on a leaderboard, was NOT successfully completed. I do plan on coming back to this
project at a later date to resubmit the assignment.
