                <p> Hi! This quiz was created so I could showcase how much I've learned so far as a webdeveloper, as well as to help others learn! </p>
                <p> Try to answer all questions within the time limit. Correct answers earn you points, wrong answers only deduct time. Good luck!</p>

<!--Pseduo Code for Reference 
1- HTML for site layout 
1.5 OPTIONAL* - Try (for fun) to create 2 html files and link together, one for a "home page" the other for the "quiz" 
2- Style pages with css (if needed, create 2 css files, one for home page one for quiz game)
3 - Add logic using js 
3.5 OPTIONAL* - Create second js file to store questions, saw something similar in a practice game I was researching on making and makes more sense than putting everyone in one js file
4 - Ensure timer works with penalty
5 - Ensure User history/scoreboard works to store name and score -->
